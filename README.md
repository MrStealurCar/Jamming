# Jammming

Jammming is a web app that allows users to search for songs, create playlists, and save them to their Spotify account.

## Description

This app was built with React and the Spotify API. It's features include:

- Allow users to search for any song or band using the Spotify API
- Add songs to a playlist
- Save playlists directly to their Spotify account

## Why This Was Built

- I built this as a portfolio project that is part of the Front End Engineer career path on Codecademy. It is one of the projects I needed to complete to earn the Front End Engineer certification at the end of the career path. It demonstrates my knowledge of API requests, and authentication.

## Getting Started Locally

- Set up a Spotify Developer account at https://developer.spotify.com/
- Make sure Node is installed
- Run 'npm install'
- Create a .env file in the root directory and set your env variables to your Spotify API credentials
- Run 'npm start'

## Deployed At

This App was deployed using Netlify: https://wejammmin.netlify.app/#

- **Note:** The App is still in development mode, which means only authorized users can search for songs, and create playlists. If you would like to use this App please send me your name, and the email you used to sign up for Spotify.
